# Security Fixes Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified by Supabase Database Linter and their resolutions.

## Critical Security Issues Identified

### 1. Security Definer Views (ERROR Level)
**Issue**: Views `database_metadata` and `payment_summary` were using `SECURITY DEFINER`
- **Risk**: These views execute with creator's permissions, potentially bypassing RLS
- **Impact**: Can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized data access

**Fix Applied**:
- Recreated views without `SECURITY DEFINER` property
- Views now use querying user's permissions (safer default behavior)

### 2. RLS Disabled on Public Tables (ERROR Level)
**Issue**: Tables `matriculas_detalle` and `user_roles` lacked Row Level Security
- **Risk**: All authenticated users could access all data in these tables
- **Impact**: Complete data exposure across user boundaries

**Fix Applied**:
- Enabled RLS on both tables
- Created granular policies for secure data access
- Implemented user-specific data isolation

## Security Policies Implemented

### matriculas_detalle Table Policies
1. **View Policy**: Users can only see their own matriculas data
2. **Insert Policy**: Users can only insert data for themselves
3. **Update Policy**: Users can only update their own data

### user_roles Table Policies
1. **User View Policy**: Users can view their own role only
2. **Admin View Policy**: Admins can view all user roles
3. **Service Role Policy**: Service role has full management access

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Execute Security Fixes
Run the `security_fixes.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- The script will:
-- 1. Drop and recreate views without SECURITY DEFINER
-- 2. Enable RLS on required tables
-- 3. Create comprehensive security policies
-- 4. Set appropriate permissions
```

### Step 2: Verify Implementation
Run the verification queries included in the script to confirm:
- ✅ RLS is enabled on all required tables
- ✅ Views no longer use SECURITY DEFINER
- ✅ Security policies are active and properly configured

### Step 3: Test Application
After applying fixes:
1. Test user authentication and authorization flows
2. Verify users can only access their own data
3. Confirm admin users retain appropriate elevated access
4. Test all CRUD operations work as expected

## Security Best Practices Applied

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users can only access data they own or are authorized to see
- Service accounts have minimal required permissions

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security (RLS + policies + permissions)
- Both table-level and row-level security controls

### 3. Secure by Default
- RLS enabled on all public tables
- Views use invoker's permissions, not definer's

## Post-Implementation Monitoring

### Regular Security Checks
Run these queries periodically to ensure security posture:

```sql
-- Check RLS status on all public tables
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND NOT rowsecurity;

-- Verify no SECURITY DEFINER views exist
SELECT viewname FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND definition ILIKE '%security definer%';
```

### Ongoing Recommendations
1. **Regular Audits**: Run Supabase Database Linter monthly
2. **Policy Reviews**: Review RLS policies when adding new features
3. **Access Monitoring**: Monitor auth logs for unusual access patterns
4. **Penetration Testing**: Test security controls regularly

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Potential unauthorized data access across user boundaries
- ❌ Views executing with elevated privileges
- ❌ Missing data isolation controls
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities flagged as ERROR level

### After Fixes
- ✅ Strong data isolation between users
- ✅ Views execute with appropriate user permissions
- ✅ Comprehensive RLS policies protecting sensitive data
- ✅ All security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Enhanced compliance with security best practices

## Support and Maintenance

### If Issues Arise
1. Check application logs for RLS policy violations
2. Review user permissions and role assignments
3. Verify policies match business requirements
4. Consider adjusting policies for new use cases

### Future Enhancements
Consider implementing:
- More granular role-based access controls
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Time-based access restrictions
- IP-based access controls
